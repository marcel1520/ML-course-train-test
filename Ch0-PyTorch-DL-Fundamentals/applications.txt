0. inside the project folder
1. conda create --prefix ./env pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
2. conda activate /Users/marcelmann/VisualStudioProjects/machine-learning/env
    creates the environment depending on the path of the project folder
3. conda install jupyter notebook
    can install missing libraries within the environment using conda install command
4. conda deactivate for exiting the current environment when changing to a different project 
5. use conda env list to view all the conda environments that exist on the computer
